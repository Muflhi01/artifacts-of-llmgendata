## Prerequisites

Install the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## First-order effects

The first order experiment for the high-level features can be executed by running `./first_order/high_level_attributes/visualize_high_level_attributes.py`

Similarly, the first order experiment for the discourse features can be executed by sequentially running the numbered scripts in `./first_order/discourse_attributes/*.py`
Please note that more in-depths experiments are going to be reported in a separate titled, "Fifty Shades of Humans: Detecting Machine-Generated Texts Through Discourse Artifacts."<br>
And the complete codebase will be at: https://github.com/minnesotanlp/fifty_shades_of_human_writers <br>


## Second-order effects
The second order experiment is conducted for the high-level features only. This can executed by running `./second_order/visualize_high_level_attributes.py`
